AppName: CurrencyConverter

My app is based on a basic currency converter and a calculator. I have provided a Web view to check the currencies prices and to double check the converter.
I created textblock,textboxes in my xaml code. Also with buttons for every input number and type of calculation desired. 
To operation text, I added an AddNumberToResult, AddOperationToResult. I then created enums for minus,plus,divide,and number.
Then to get the desired result, I defined a tree structure. I then get the experssion from result.text and build a tree with it.
Then the final step is to evaluate tree structure.

In the Exchange rate, You enter the current exchange rate price of the currency(e.g USD/JPY = 106.50), enter the amount you wish to convert and the answer is calcualted then. 


Note: I emailed you about the issues I am having about getting into the windows store. I am still not getting the option to enter via student link. I will notify you as soon as I hear different. Thanks,
